# About

This is my attempt to redesign my developerly and writerly experience, from the
ground up, with Emacs. The smart move would have been to stick with
*[prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude "prelude emacs starter kit")* and
fix *my* gunk instead. However, for better or worse, it was that time in my
developer life-cycle. And so here we are.
